# Hi! I'm Satyajit Ranjeev. 

Here you will find my personal notes, thoughts, and drafts of long forms. This is my experiment with [[Digital Gardening]]. These are thoughts that evolve from time to time. You will find quotes, books that I read, some random stuffs. 

I can't promise everything here is going to be well edited, but I can promise that items without the #Draft tag will be well thought through.

Here are some of my recent articles:

{{sh `
ls *.txt | grep -v '^_' | sed 's/\.txt$//' | awk '{printf "<li><a href=\"%s\">%s</a></li>", $0, $0}'
`}}

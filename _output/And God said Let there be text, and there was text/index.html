      <h1 class="title">And God said Let there be text, and there was text</h1>
      
      <p>** Update 2021: I stopped working on this project and saola no longer is what I built. **</p>
<p>And God said &quot;Let there be text, and there was text&quot;. This would be the start of the bible if the historians of UNIX wrote one. <code>/etc/passwd</code>, <code>/var/log/messages</code>, <code>~/.bashrc</code> etc, all these wonderful ways of storing information in a very simple and importantly easily accessible format of file. It was all text.</p>
<p>In this age we are so concerned about speed and scalability that we forget a lot of what is essential. Sometimes storing my personal finances, a list of my contacts or my task, all it needs is a text file. I can always use <code>grep</code> <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> to manipulate them. I can fire up my favourite editor[^1] and modify it. I can store my files in my local harddisk, sync it with Dropbox or put them in some remote server that I can access. If one of these services die I always have my text files and not have to worry if I can open them.</p>
<p>A while back I wanted to create a simple application for my iPhone. All I wanted was to store information as plain text, write small scripts that would generate reports. It turned out to be quite a task. This got me thinking about how we do things in the UNIX world. User details are stored in <code>/etc/passwd</code>. Logs, configurations, startup scripts[^2] all of them are stored as plain text and I could use any language to manipulate them. And thus started my process of developing <a href="https://saola.in">Saola</a>.</p>
<p>Saola is something that has come out of a need in the mobile platform. It is a place to store your text. But it does something important where the likes of Evernote or Simplenote fail. It provides a scriptable environment[^3]. Your content is stored as plain text[^4]. With the JavaScript environment provided you can write tools to manipulate your text. You can integrate with external tools by <code>POST</code>ing to the script that you have written.</p>
<p>Even though a lot of work has gone on developing it is still in a very early stage. There are features that we haven't implemented yet, there are things that would definitely break. But this is the beginning of a new era. It is like one said on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10830587">HN</a>: A note platform for the web 3.0.</p>
<p>Here are a few plans that we have in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a nice sync feature. I really would like to use existing tools like <code>rsync</code> or <code>scp</code></li>
<li>Be able to render various text formats like csv, org, rst etc.</li>
<li>Make it more like the UNIX filesystem</li>
<li>More language support, may be a lisp?</li>
</ul>
<p>Spread the word, give it a shot and let me know what you think. Register at Saola.</p>
<p>[^1]: Emacs for me and vi for the evil ones ;)
[^2]: Sadly systemd is taking it away from me
[^3]: Currenly JavaScript, as much as I complain about it, it was something that was easy to integrate
[^4]: UTF-8</p>

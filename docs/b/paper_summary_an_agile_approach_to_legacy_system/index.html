      <h1 class="title">An Agile Approach to a Legacy System</h1>
      
      <p>I recently read an interesting paper, &quot;An Agile Approach to a Legacy System&quot;[1], on how to migrate legacy systems. One statement resonated with me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The drive for the original rewrite came from development management and developers not business and users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have been involved in two major refactoring which was initiated by Engineers. One barely successful and the other a semi failure. It is easy to get excited about a rewrite to improve performance or because the code is messy to deal with. One hardly thinks about the business use case for such.</p>
<p>The author describes how and why they approached migrating a legacy system and what should be the motivation for such. In the narration he provided a few rule of thumbs that were interesting. I have listed them below for convenience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't reproduce legacy code</li>
<li>Always ask the users what the problem is</li>
<li>Refactor a legacy application by delivering new business value</li>
<li>Incrementally build trust - prove that you can do the hardest part of the system.</li>
<li>Build a small, self-selected team</li>
<li>Don't get hung up on process</li>
<li>Involve the whole team with larger refactorings so that the team can move on as quickly as possible</li>
<li>Effective teams need break points</li>
<li>Treat politics as a user requirement</li>
<li>A System that connects to a legacy system must be tested using live feeds</li>
<li>Engage users and they not only won't they turn it off, they will fight some of your battles for you</li>
<li>Keep giving a good team motivated by giving them new hard problems - don't waste a good team</li>
</ul>
<p>A few things like &quot;Treat politics as a user requirement&quot; is thought provoking. But other things like &quot;Don't get hung up on process&quot; and &quot;Build a small, self-selected team&quot; resonates to what others have said.</p>
<p>I would recommend reading it even if you don't have to rewrite legacy systems. A very short read and full of wisdom.</p>

I picked this up in Shakespeare and Sons, a cafe and book shop. I didn't know that Haruki was a runner. It was, naturally, nice to see him write a book about it. I had been thinking of running, as I recovered from my illness. It was a rough time.

# Thoughts
Murakami, describes how the hour he spends on running is a private time, important to help him keep his mental well-being. I share this is my sentiment of running alone.

It's all about routines. (p. 78)

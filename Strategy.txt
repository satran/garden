Strategy

> An integrative set of choices that positions you on a playing field of your choice in a way you win.

Strategy is a theory
	this is the playing field, and how I will be better than the others in this

eg: Southwest airlines - strategy for winning

- Strategy will have angst - accept it
	- it will make you feel somewhat nervous
	- you can't prove in advance that your strategy will succeed
	- If our theory is right this will position us in an excellent way
	- be okay that you don't know 
- Layout the logic of your strategy clearly - then tweak it
- Keep it short and simple 
	- not letting it get complicated**
